## Data Preparation

We have decided to use Google Colab, but you are free to choose any platform for object detection.

**Tip**: When using YOLO for object detection in Colab, it is best **NOT** to mount your Google Drive. Instead, upload a ZIP folder containing your data locally. This will significantly speed up the scanning process.

For the annotation of the images used in the training/validation phase, [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) has been adopted, but it is possible to use whatever annotator that you like. The most important thing is to have everything in the YOLO format.
